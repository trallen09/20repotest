# Team Centennial Project!

## Team Roles
* Square - Thomas - GitHub
* Circle - Chris - SQL
* Triangle - Shana - Machine Learning
* X - Adam - Everything else

### Week 2
* Lessons learned
	* Properly format the date if the analysis is based on a time series.
	* This conversion of the date to time delta improved the performance of the model.

### Week 1 for Machine Learning
* Created basic plan for machine learning processing of the data.
* Included different aspects that need to be considered during the process.
* Based on the dataset, different models and strategies will be tried.

#### Dataset Description
Data provided on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/zillow-house-price-data?select=Sale_Prices_City.csv. This data is U.S. housing market compiled from zillow.com.   
#### Format


## Data Choice

#### Team Centennial park chose data that useful to anyone looking to purchase a home in Tennessee. We will focusing the data to look specifically at this market but it could be used for other states. We will building a machine learning model to help predict the future prices of houses of varying sizes.
